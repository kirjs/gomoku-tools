Gomoku Tools
============

This is a library to simplify common operation with gomoku board.

The plan is to make it work for renju and gomoku games, as well as with any other mnk game.
 
 
Simple example: 
 
```javascript
    var game = new Game();
    game.moveTo('H8');
    game.moveTo('H9');
    game.moveTo('I8');
   
    

'''
